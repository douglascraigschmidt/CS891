<h3>Database Microservice (Assignment 2b)</h3>

<p>The purpose of the second part of this assignment is to deepen your
understanding of how to develop multiple synchronous microservices
with <A HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-tutorial">Spring
WebMVC</A>, the <A
HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka">Eureka
Discovery Service</A>, the <A
HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-gateway">Spring Cloud
Gateway</A>, the <A HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/retrofit">Retrofit
type-safe client API</a>, and the <A
HREF="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/persistence-jsp.html">Jakarta
Persistence API</A> (JPA).  In this assignment you'll apply JPA to
create a database that stores information about movies and supports
various SQL queries (including a custom SQL query), as well as apply
Retrofit to create several type-safe client APIs that access database
and timer microservices via an API gateway. </p>

<p> The code you'll write for this assignment does not have a GUI and
runs as an Spring application with an integration main program. Please
feel free to use this main program to help debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li> A tutorial on the Jakarta Persistence API appears <A

<li> A tutorial on Retrofit appears <A
HREF="https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Retrofit/article.html">here</A>.

<li> I also recommend you use <A
HREF="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</A> to help learn and code
these various APIs.
</ul>

<p>Naturally, we'll cover this material in class, which will be
available in my YouTube <A

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The Database microservice is packaged as a project using <A
HREF="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</A>.  This app is
written in Java and demonstrates various Spring WebMVC and Java
concurrency and persistence features.  For the purposes of Assignment
2b, however, just focus on the following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="client/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/">client</A>, which
contains a client main driver program containing proxy skeleton(s)
you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="database/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/database">database</A>,
which contains the database microservice server skeleton(s) you'll
need to fill in, as also described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

</UL>

You'll also need to copy the synchronous movies-ex microservice
implementation from <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignment2a/">assignment
2a</A>, which is found in these folders:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies-ex/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/moviesex">movies-ex</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies-ex/src/test/java/edu/vandy/recommender/moviesex">movies-ex/src/test</A>,
which is a set of unit tests that exercise the features you're
implementing to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
earlier assignment's requirements.  </LI>

</UL>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" markers
or your submission will not be reviewed)!!!  In particular, you'll
need to finish implementing the "TODO" tasks for this assignment in
the following files and folders:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="client/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/">client</A>, where
you'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various fields/methods to
implement a type-safe client using Retrofit. </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="database/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/database">database</A>,
where you'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various
fields/methods of the <A
HREF="database/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/database/server/MultiQueryRepositoryImpl.java">MultiQueryRepositoryImpl.java</A>
and <A
HREF="database/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/database/server/DatabaseService.java">DatabaseService.java</A>
files that use declarative and programmatic features of the Jakarta
Persistence API together with Java parallel streams to return lists of
objects containing information about movies.

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> You'll also need to complete the "TODO"
tasks in factory methods in the <A
HREF="database/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/database/common/ServerBeans.java">ServerBeans.java</A>
and <A
HREF="client/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/common/ClientBeans.java">ClientBeans.java</A>
files that can be injected into Java classes using the Spring
Autowired annotation. </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em">Finally, you'll need to implement the
"TODO" tasks in the <A
HREF="common/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/common/model/Movie.java">Movie.java</A>
file.  </UL>

<p> As usual, your solution should strive to use few (if any) loops or
if/else statements in this assignment and instead use Java functional
programming features (including lambda expressions, method references,
and parallel stream aggregate operations). Your solution will be
considered correct if it passes all the unit tests, is commented
thoroughly, and addresses my review comments. Solutions that are not
commented thoroughly will not be reviewed.</p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignment2b/">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Please pull this skeleton code into your
GitLab repository, read it carefully, and complete the "TODO" tasks.

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> There are unit tests that exercise all the "TODO" tasks you must
complete.  To compile and run these tests you need to use the provided
IntelliJ project.  You can run all the unit tests by opening the
Gradle tab, followed by navigating down to the "Tasks > verification >
check" submenu. All you need to do is double click on the "check"
submenu and all the tests will build and run automatically. </P>

<p> These tests increase our collective confidence that your solution
is working as expected.  As usual, testing only demonstrates the
presence of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely solely on the tests
to detect problems in your code. In particular, I will also provide
videos that walk through "frequently made mistakes" that you should
address.  Please address these issues prior to your submission(s) to
streamline our <A
HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs891/assignments.html">programming
assignment review and assessment</A> process.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 2b is designed to further deepen your understanding of
developing multiple synchronous microservices using Spring WebMVC, the
Eureka Discovery Service, the Spring Cloud Gateway, the Retrofit
type-safe client API, and the Jakarta Persistence API.  The skeletons
and tests are quite extensive, though you don't need to understand
them all to complete your solution.  This assignment is a bit more
complicated than assignment 2a, so please start early and ask
questions in class, office hours, and on the discussion forums to
ensure you complete this assignment successfully!  </p>
