<h3>Java ExecutorService Framework and Core Synchronizers (Assignment 2 - Part A)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objective of Part A of this assignment is to learn how to use
the Java Executor Service framework.  Videos describing the Java
Executor Service appear <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf9ND5idTRg&t=65s&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=44">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtsLYfQlbaM&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=45">here</a>.
I recommend you watch these videos to ensure you understand the Java
Executor Service.  Naturally, we'll cover these topics in class, as
well. </P>

<P>In this part of the assignment you will use an instance of the Java
ExecutorService class that's created as a "fixed-size" pool of threads
to enhance the multi-threaded implementation of the PalantiriSimulator
app from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment1a/">Assignment
1A</A>. Assignment 2A focuses on creating a pool of threads that allow
beings to concurrently gaze into a fixed number of palantiri.  By now,
you should understand what <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir">palantiri</a> are!</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project using the
latest version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin
and Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 2A, however, you only need to be aware of the
following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/executorService/">app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/executorService</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of JUnit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.  <P>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 26, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 26. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<A name="description">
<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks!!!  In particular, you'll need to
finish implementing the following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in
the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/executorService">executorService</A>
folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/executorService/ExecutorServiceMgr.java">ExecutorServiceMgr.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a BeingManager via a fixed-size thread pool using the Java
ExecutorService. </P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/executorService/BeingCallable.java">BeingCallable.java</A>.
You'll need to complete a couple of methods in this class. </P>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/utils/Assignment.java">Assignment.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" to set the <CODE>sTypes</CODE>
field to either <CODE>GRADUATE</CODE> or <CODE>UNDERGRADUATE</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI>

</UL>

<P>You'll also need to integrate your solution for the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/spinLockHashMap">spinLockHashMap</A>
folder from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment1b/">Assignment
1B</a> into the latest/greatest <CODE>spinLockHashMap</CODE> skeleton
and use it as implementation of the PalantiriManager for Assignment
2A.  In Assignment 2B you'll revise the PalantiriManager solution to
use different Java synchronizers. </P>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A correct simulation should restrict the number
of gazing beings to the number of palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four palantiri in the simulation, then only four beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show palantiri and being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct and does not throw any exceptions the app title bar labels
will appear green when the simulation completes. If the implementation
throws an exception or is not implemented correctly when the
simulation completes the red title bar labels will be displayed when
the simulation completes.</P>

<H4>Additional "TO DO" Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

<P>Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must perform the following additional task(s):</P>

<UL>

<LI> Enhance the <CODE>ExecutorServiceMgr.java</CODE> file to use Java
streams and associated functional programming features (e.g., method
references and/or lambda expressions).

</UL>

<P>Undergraduates are welcome to implement these methods/features, but
it's not required.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment2a/">GitHub</a>
account.  After you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This assignment is designed to deepen your knowledge of writing
concurrent Java programs using a thread pool, which enhances the core
Java multi-threading mechanisms we covered in Assignment 1A.  It
doesn't require you to program any Android concurrency frameworks,
which we'll cover in upcoming assignments.</P>
