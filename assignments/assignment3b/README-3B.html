<h3>Java ExecutorCompletionService Framework, Java ConcurrentHashMap, and Fair Semaphore (Assignment 3 - Part B)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objective of Part B of this assignment is to learn how to
synchronize beings via a ConcurrentHashMap and a fair semaphore
(implemented using the <A
HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/specific-notification.pdf"><EM>Specific
Notification</EM></A> pattern).  Videos describing the relevant topics
appear as follow:

<UL>
<LI> <B>Java ConcurrentHashMap</B> -- <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-33gly5Qy0s&index=45&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp6r_dM7BNs-9PzTc-ZKjomg&t=1s">here</a>.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> <B>Specific Notification pattern</B> -- <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fegw8P8o5FI">here</a>.
</UL>

Please watch these videos to ensure you understand these Java
synchronizers.  Naturally, we'll cover these topics in class, as
well. </P>

<P>In this part of the assignment you will enhance the
PalantiriManager portion of the PalantiriSimulator app from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment3a/">Assignment
3A</A>, which implemented the BeingManager via
ExecutorCompletionService and ExecutorService.  Assignment 3B focuses
on applying a ConcurrentHashMap and <EM>Specific
Notification</EM>-based ``Fair'' semaphore to the PalantiriManager,
which is used to restrict the number of beings from Middle-Earth who
can concurrently gaze into a fixed number of palantiri. </P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project using the
latest version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin
and Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 3B, however, you only need to be aware of the
following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/">app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of JUnit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.  <P>

</UL>

<P>You'll also need to integrate your enhanced solution for the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/completionService">completionService</A>
folder from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment3a/">Assignment
3A</a> into the latest/greatest <CODE>completionService</CODE>
skeleton and use it as implementation of the BeingManager for
Assignment 3B (make sure to address all my comments from Assignment 3A
into your Assignment 3B solution). </P>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 26, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 26. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks!!!  In particular, you'll need to
finish implementing the following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in
the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore">concurrentMapFairSemaphore</A>
folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/ConcurrentMapFairSemaphoreMgr.java">ConcurrentMapFairSemaphoreMgr.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to implement a
PalantiriManager via a ConcurrentHashMap and a FairSemaphore.  </P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/FairSemaphoreMO.java">FairSemaphoreMO.java</A>. Undergraduate
students need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a ``fair semaphore'' using built-in Java monitor
objects. </P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/FairSemaphoreCO.java">FairSemaphoreCO.java</A>. Graduate
students need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a ``fair semaphore'' using Java ReentrantLocks and
ConditionObjects. </P>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/utils/Assignment.java">Assignment.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" to set the <CODE>sTypes</CODE>
field to either <CODE>GRADUATE</CODE> or <CODE>UNDERGRADUATE</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A correct simulation should restrict the number
of gazing beings to the number of palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four palantiri in the simulation, then only four beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show palantiri and being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct and does not throw any exceptions the app title bar labels
will appear green when the simulation completes. However, red title
bar labels will be displayed when the simulation completes if the
implementation throws an exception or is not implemented
correctly.</P>

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment3b/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. </P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This part of the assignment is designed to deepen your
understanding of synchronizing multi-threaded programs using the Java
ConcurrentHashMap and the <EM>Specific Notification</EM> pattern.  The
fair semaphore implementation is tricky, so please start early and
come to office hours if you have questions. </P>
