<h3>Movies Microservice (Assignment 1a)</h3>

<p>The purpose of the first part of this two-part assignment is to
acquaint you with developing synchronous microservices with <A
HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-tutorial">Spring WebMVC</A>.
In particular, in this assignment you'll develop a synchronous
microservice that uses Spring WebMVC to return List objects containing
information about movies.</p>

<p> The code you'll write for this assignment does not have a GUI and
runs as an Spring application with an automated test program. Please
feel free to use this test program to help debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li> An overview of Spring WebMVC appears <A
HREF="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html">here</A>. <P>

<li> Professor Jules White's <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyUlngzGzkztBIalEW89Hr04lXPbdz1QJ">YouTube
playlist</A> has an excellent overview of Spring Web MVC. </li>

</ul>

<p>Naturally, we'll cover this material in class, which will be
available in my YouTube <A

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The Movies microservice is packaged as a project using <A
HREF="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</A>.  This app is
written in Java and demonstrates various Spring WebMVC features.  For
the purposes of Assignment 1a, however, you only need to be aware of
the following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies">recommender/movies</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/test/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies">movies/src/test</A>,
which is a set of unit tests that exercise the features you're
implementing to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
assignment's requirements.  </LI>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided IntelliJ project.
You can run this project by clicking the green arrow next to the
"MoviesTest" dropbox menu in the IntelliJ IDE.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO"
markers)!!!  In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the
following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in the following files and
folders:

<UL>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies/MoviesController.java">MoviesController.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various fields/methods to
define endpoint handler methods that return List objects containing
information about movies. </LI>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies/MoviesService.java">MoviesService.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various fields/methods
called by the <code>MoviesController</code> to return List objects
containing information about movies.

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies/Components.java">Components.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in factory methods (known as
"Beans") that can be injected into Java classes using the Spring
Autowired annotation to load a dataset containing movie titles and
descriptive vectors. </LI>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/test/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies/MoviesSyncProxy.java">MoviesSyncProxy.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks to implement proxies to
various endpoints in the Movies microservice. </LI>
</UL>

<p> Your solution should strive to use <EM>no</EM> loops or if/else
statements in this assignment and instead use Java sequential stream
aggregate operations and functional programming features. Your
solution will be considered correct if it passes all the unit tests,
is commented thoroughly, and addresses my review comments.</p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignment1a/">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Please setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account, pull this
skeleton code into your repository, read it carefully, and complete
the "TODO" markers.

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> The unit tests in the <A
HREF="movies/src/test/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies">movies/src/test</A>
folder are provided to increase our collective confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  As usual, testing only
demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely
solely on the unit tests to detect problems in your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 1a is designed to acquaint you with developing
synchronous microservices using Spring WebMVC.  The skeletons and unit
tests are subtle, though you don't need to understand them all to
complete your solution.  Please start early and ask questions in
class, office hours, and on the discussion forums to ensure you
complete this assignment successfully! </p>
